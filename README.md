# Petition Management System
## Overview

The Petition Management System allows users to create petitions, sign existing petitions, and view all petitions in the system. With a sleek and user-friendly interface, managing petitions has never been easier!

## Key Features

### AJAX Integration

I leveraged AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) to provide seamless interaction with the server without requiring a page reload. This ensures a smooth and responsive user experience, making petition management quick and efficient.

### PHP Backend

The PHP backend powers the core functionality of the system, handling tasks such as petition creation, signing, and retrieval. With PHP, we ensure secure and robust data processing, making our system reliable and scalable.

### HTML & CSS Styling

Our system boasts a modern and visually appealing interface thanks to HTML and CSS. Petitions are displayed in a clean and organized layout, enhancing readability and user engagement.

## How It Works

1. **Create a Petition:**
   - Users can easily create a new petition by providing a title, description, and other relevant details. The petition is then added to the system for others to sign.

2. **Sign a Petition:**
   - Users can browse through existing petitions and sign those they support. The system records each signature, allowing petition creators to gauge support and track progress.

3. **View Petitions:**
   - All petitions in the system are displayed in a centralized dashboard, making it convenient for users to explore and discover new causes to support.
